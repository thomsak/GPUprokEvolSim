Simulation of prokaryotic genomes using GPUs

Copyright Thomas Sakoparnig

You can run python recombSim4Letters.py -h to get further information on how to run the simulation software.
After your simulation is complete you can run python analyseGenotypes4Letters.py in order to generate a phylip format multiple
alignment file. 

In order to run it you need to have Python 3 and the numba package (http://numba.pydata.org/) installed. Furthermore, you need to have a CUDA compatible GPU installed at your system.
